```
npm install
```

## Contributing
- Fork the repository
- Add a photo of yourself at `people/yourname.jpg`. Try to keep the image around 500px wide
- Add an object into the `people` array in `people.json` with your name, photo, description, website, and GitHub username
  - You don't need to add the `http://` to the beginning of the website, that gets added automatically.
  - If you switched into CS, add `cs: true`
- Create a <a href="https://github.com/icechen1/softi.es/compare">pull request</a>
